We are living in a digital world and transacting online using credit cards has become the norm and due to this we need stronger cyber security than ever before.
To tacle this problem we need a system that detects if a transaction is fraudlent or not.

Below is an analysis using python that does this.I have used machine learning algorithms to help classify if a transaction is anbormal or not
The dataset used is from Kaggle and cointain real bank transactions of different card holders.

2. [**Ignaz-handwashing-analysis**](https://github.com/karennjoki/Ignaz-handwashing-analysis/blob/main/Ignaz%20Handwashing%20Project-checkpoint.ipynb)

In the early 1800’s, many women passed away due to puerperal fever (commonly known as childbed fever) and Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, an assistant professor at John Hopkins 
School of Public Health, became interested in better understanding why this was the case.

Semmelweis began collecting data at two maternity clinics, one that was staffed solely by male doctors and medical students, with the other clinic staffed by female
midwives. Sammelweis suspected that a reason for the difference in mortality rate between the two clinics (as we will see below) is due to the simple act of 
handwashing.
